### What is NodeJS?

NodeJS is a javascript runtime. It uses the chrome v8 engine to compile JS code into machine code. NodeJS adds extra features that the chrome engine lacks. For example the option to access the local file system. Also some features from the browser are missing, like the ability to access the HTML DOM. In a statement, NodeJS is Javascript on the server.

### Javascript on the Server
NodeJs lets us write a webserver with javascript. As a JavaScript runtime NodeJs is not limited to running a server. It can be used to run any code we want locally. As NodeJs has access to the local file system it is also suited for utility scripts, build tools ect.

With NodeJS unlike PHP, Java ect. witch is only the code that runs on a server NodeJs also runs the server. With NodeJs we write the code for our server, thus no extra tools are required. A huge advantage of NodeJs is that it lets us use JavasScript on both the server and client side.
